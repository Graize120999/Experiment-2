// The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence which starts with 0 and 1, with subsequent numbers
// of the sequence (called Fibonacci numbers) being the sum of the previous two. Thus, the first few terms of
// the sequence are: 0,1,1,2,3,5,8,â€¦ Create a program that will output the NEXT 20 Fibonacci 
// numbers (after 0 and 1) in one line, separated by commas.
